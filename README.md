# Random Finance Posts
This is a place to store random finance posts whenever I get to them. So far:
* [Duration of a growing perpetuity](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-finance-posts/blob/main/duration-growing-perpetuity.ipynb): Quick note on the derivation of the duration of a growing perpetuity.
* [Trading strategy breakeven answer](https://github.com/limits-to-arbitrage/random-finance-posts/blob/main/breakeven_question.ipynb): Answer to a Twitter question posed by a senior quant analyst regarding a hypothetical trading strategy's breakeven win percentage: If a strategy wins $W$% or loses $L$%, what win percentage is assumed when the expection is for breakeven?

If this gets lengthier, I'll make an index.
