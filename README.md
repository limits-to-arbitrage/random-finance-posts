# Random Finance Posts
This is a place to store random finance posts whenever I get to them. So far:
* [Duration of a growing perpetuity](duration-growing-perpetuity.ipynb): Quick note on the derivation of the duration of a growing perpetuity.
* [Trading strategy breakeven answer](fill): Answer to a Twitter question posed by a quant analyst regarding a hypothetical trading strategy's breakeven win percentage.

If this gets lengthier, I'll make an index.
